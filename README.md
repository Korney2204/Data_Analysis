# Miscellaneous data analysis projects

### 1)I took data from one of the tasks from Kaggle.com "Titanic" and analysed it.
I answered the following questions:
* 1) Who were the passangers on the titanic?
* 2) What deck were the passangers on and how does that relate to their class?
* 3) Where did the passangers come from?
* 4) Who was alone and who was with family?
* 5) What factors helped someone to survive the sinking?
And used decision tree in order to identify which factors very the most important one.
