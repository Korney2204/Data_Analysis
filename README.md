# Miscellaneous data analysis projects
This projects were done just for my own purpose in order to practise in data analyses, thus some parts of the explanations are missed.

### I took data from one of the tasks from Kaggle.com "Titanic".
I answered the following questions:
1) Who were the passangers on the titanic?
2) What deck were the passangers on and how does that relate to their class?
3) Where did the passangers come from?
4) Who was alone and who was with family?
5) What factors helped someone to survive the sinking?
And used decision tree in order to identify which factors very the most important one.

### I took stocks data of four largest tech companies: Apple, Microsoft, Amazone, Google.
I answered the following questions:
1) What was the change in price of the stock?
2) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
3) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
4) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
5) How much value we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
And used Monte Carlo method in order to predict future prices.
